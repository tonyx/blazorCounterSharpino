# blazorWithSharpinoExample

The counter example from the Blazor documentation, but with a twist. The counter is implemented in F# using the Sharpino library.

Note: I am looking for different alternatives to integrate Sharpino with any web app.

This example uses one of the Sharpino demo (a counter) and integrates it with a Blazor C# app.

Thoughts: I'd like to use Result and "railway oriented" approach in C# as well, and not only F#.
At the moment I am using plain old try/catch or if/then blocks.

However: the example proves that using F# and Sharpino in the backend and Blazor as a frontend is a viable option.
